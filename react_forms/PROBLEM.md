## Objective
This exercise is created to get hands on with creating React forms and how to handle multiple form elements

## To Do
- Fork the boilerplate
- Clone the forked repository to local system
- Open terminal in forked project location and run `npm i` command to install dependency
- Follow the instruction in each `.js` file in components folder to complete the assignment

## Final Output of App:

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Central Education Council has introduced smart and interactive learning for the students. To implement the scheme, the Council has proposed to distribute smart devices to students of class 2 - 5. The smart device has been programmed in a way that the students may find all required learning amenities at one place. 

The Council hired developers from Top MNCs to build this product. Your Team has been assigned the task to develop a simple calculator application that performs basic mathematical operations(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division).

Design a simple calculator with the following requirements:
1. Enable user input of type number.
2. Handle multiple form inputs by the User.
3. Capture the values entered by the User and perform arithmetic operations on the fetched data.
4. Arithmetic operations covered : Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
5. Consider negative scenarious while calculating the output(e.g. first number entered by the user is less than the second. In such scenarios, negate the result and show the final output)

Create a React application and use form handling mechanisms to achieve the above result
